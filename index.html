			  Since 2019, I have been working as a Software Engineer at Google. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago. I have a Master's degree from Saarland University in Germany, and have held Research Assistant/Scientist positions at the Max-Planck Institute T&uuml;bingen, Germany. My undergraduate studies in Computer Science were completed at IIT Bombay. </p>
			  <p>I have published in multiple areas within AI/Machine Learning, spanning bioinformatics, unsupervised learning, matrix factorization, multi-task learning, deep learning, and neural network interpretability. Most recently at Google, I have worked on improving Machine Learning models for user-ad and user-product interactions such as clicks and conversions.</p>
